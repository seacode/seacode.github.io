# Gmacs Progress Report September 2014
### by Athol Whitten, Jim Ianelli, Andre Punt

## Gmacs Project Overview

3. Gmacs will remain at Seacode, the Council will decide who 'manages' the code.

Recommomendations for management:
  * NOAA should maintain some involvement: but should be one player rather than the sole. Thus, ADFG, SARDI, etc. 
  * Crab Plan Team could designate people who are 'the gate keepers', this could be the top level above the 'developers' list. 
  * Feeds into discussion about other software, Buck's Tanner model for example could sit alongside Gmacs, and used for multi-model inference at assessment time.
  * Independent people could be sub-contracted to do large pieces of coding as requested/identified by the CPT.


## Gmacs

1. Can we now rename Gsmac to Gmacs? 
  * What is the process for doing this wrt Github?

2. Run through the TODO list on the Github Site.
  * See `WhittenDeveloper` Branch for updated README and TODO

* Makefile needs to be made platform agnostic: Jim will work on this. There is only one makefile in the gmacs/src directory now. 


### BBRKC Example

Jie has provided more information regarding his (ADFG) BBRKC model specific to the use if weight- and fecundity-at-size information. The information has been summarised in the `README.me` file in the Gmacs Shared Folder under ADFG. 

### Documentation

1. Idea: produce a general paper (technical document) that could be published (PlosONE) and serve as the first reference for Gmacs. The existing Word Document can be converted to Latex (then MD) as a starting point.
2. Github:
  * Github Wiki: Servers as a User Guide. i.e. 'How to make the model run', and can be turned into a PDF for distribution as required.
  * Github README: Serves as a general overview and starting point
3. Doxygen generated documentation. This needs work.
4. Second paper using Gmacs for reasearch: Size-classes simulation. Submit to CAPAM Growth Workshop.

### R Package

1. The R package `gmr` is now setup and working with a few minimal examples at https://github.com/seacode/gmr 
2. The R package code files have internal Roxygen comments to generate documentation.
3. R Package code follows the 'Advanced R Style Guide' by Hadley Wickham

# Cstar

* What portions of Gmacs code should be moved to Cstar?
* Rstar is R code in support of Cstar: Shiny might work well here.

Cstar needs some attention, the functions in Gmacs/src at the moment.  

# Extra Notes:

# Sim Flag will call simulation_model() function. 

This, at the moment, using a rmv_logistic() function. This is a mismatch to the 'default' distribution assumption of the estimation model, which uses an assumed multinomial() distrubution when determining the predicted catch comp observations.

--------------------------
Notes on gmacs.tpl (new)

INITIALIZATION_SECTION
  First 5 parms: are read in at this point, at the moment they are fixed values for the BBRKC model, so need to be made part of the control file.


FUNCTION calc_fishing_mortality
  For years and gears for which there is catch data, F values are estimated directly. Thus, in the data, catches or zero, can be entered, or not, both will work, but zeros will be ignored. 

  TODO, the model does not currently accommodate situations where there is data on effort but not on catch, nor where there is effort and a recorded zero catch. This is a future extension option.


 GENERAL NOTES
  Old shell, new shell, infrastructure exists, but is not working yet. This is a major priority.

  The next is adding time-varying options for M and other things not yet set-up, seems selex is the only one now with time-varying options now.

  Growth is in the code now, should go to Cstar. There is also no time-varying growth, that should be added as a second level priority.

  At is used twice, once in the update_population and equil_conditions section, as the name for the transition matix. It is A, then the transpose of A. Which one of these is reported? 

  Jim identified a penalty issue that needs to be dealt with. 

  Critical issue: need to deal with maturity- and shell-

--------------------------

DATA: CHECK JIE'S DATA: On Maturity, what information is there? Any? Answer seems to be NO.

Check ALL DATA: make sure it is being specified correctly in our new model.

Check: Fecundity vs. Maturity: The fecudnity vector that is used now, is that used for mature male biomas?

From Jie: Fecundity is not used, so ignore it anyway. Mature is binary, a step function. 1 over a certain size for males and females seperately. 

CHECK WHY ANDRE HAD/USED a FECUNDITY VECTOR? Why was it there, do we need to care.

When reviewing BBRKC models b/w ADFG and Gmacs, make this part of a document because a comparison will be required for the September meeting.

Move BBRKC folder from Projects/Cstar/Models to ./Gmacs/Models and change the name to simple_bbrkc

Work through seacode/gmacs issues and raise new given meeting outcomes

Suggest splitting current documentation into two parts, one for user guide (wiki) and another for paper (technical description)

Check for objections first: then remove depracated branches from seacode (?) can we get back to Github Workflow soon? With development going on in developer branch, and each new feature as separate branch
