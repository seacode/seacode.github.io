# Gmacs Project Progress Report 
# September 2014
### by Athol R. Whitten
## Overview

The Gmacs project is now hosted online at https://seacode.github.io, along with three other projects running in support of, or parallel to Gmacs: **gmr**, an R package for plotting the results of Gmacs models, **Cstar**, an ADMB library of common stock assessment routines which are used inside Gmacs, and **rstar** a supporting R package to the Cstar project which allows users to plot and learn about Cstar functions.

## Progress
Great progress has been made over the 2014 summer. The Gmacs source code has recently undergone a complete re-write, resulting in the addition of new and improved functionality and better-documented code.

The Gmacs project now has:

1. A Github project page for collaborative model development: https://github.com/seacode/gmacs website
2. Functioning core code, developed using ADMB: https://github.com/seacode/gmacs/blob/develop/src/gmacs.tpl
3. A user- and developer-guide in wiki format: https://github.com/seacode/gmacs/wiki
4. A technical document in the form of a journal manuscript (currently a draft): https://github.com/seacode/gmacs/blob/develop/docs/manuscript/GLBAM.tex
5. A supporting R package for producing plots from Gmacs output files: https://github.com/seacode/gmr
6. An example stock assessment model and associated report: https://github.com/seacode/gmacs/tree/develop/docs/bbrkc

## Planning
All the things that should come next, including repeating this process for the NSRKC assessment. There will be another post-doc to continue this work.

## Summary
The Gmacs modelling framework can now satisfactorily reproduce the results of the existing ADFG model for BBRKC. The new and improved core modelling code and improved work-flow stock assessment process should enable the NPFMC and ADFG to...
