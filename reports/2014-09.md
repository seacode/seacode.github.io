# Gmacs Progress Report 
## by Athol R. Whitten, September 2014

## Overview
Gmacs is a statistical catch-at-size population modeling framework. It is designed to be flexible, scalable, useful for both data-limited and data-rich situations, and initially, to improve and support management of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Island (BSAI) crab stocks of Alaska. The project is a collaborative effort between the University of Washington and NOAA Fisheries for the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council ([NPFMC](http://www.npfmc.org)). It is hoped that Gmacs will enable the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) to greatly improve the development of assessment models for their crab stocks.

The Gmacs project is now hosted online at https://seacode.github.io, along with three other projects running in support of, or parallel to, Gmacs. Those projects are:

1. **`gmr`** an R package for plotting the results of Gmacs models; 
2. **`Cstar`** an ADMB library of common stock assessment routines which are used inside Gmacs; and
3. **`rstar`** an R package that facilitates plotting and understanding of Cstar functions.

A presentation outlining the motivation behind Gmacs, its capabilities, and its intended use as part of an improved stock assessment process, can be accessed at: https://seacode.github.io/reports/2014-09-slides.pdf

## Progress
Great progress has been made over the 2014 summer. The Gmacs source code has recently undergone a complete re-write, resulting in the addition of new and improved functionality and better-documented code. In additional, the Gmacs project now has:

1. An improved Github project page for collaborative model development: https://github.com/seacode/gmacs
2. Recently re-written and re-designed core ADMB source code: https://github.com/seacode/gmacs/blob/develop/src/gmacs.tpl
3. A user- and developer-guide in wiki format: https://github.com/seacode/gmacs/wiki
4. A technical document in the form of a journal manuscript (currently a first-draft): https://github.com/seacode/gmacs/blob/develop/docs/manuscript/GLBAM.tex
5. A supporting R package for producing plots from Gmacs output files: https://github.com/seacode/gmr
6. A demonstration stock assessment model: https://github.com/seacode/gmacs/tree/develop/examples/demo
7. An associated report: https://github.com/seacode/gmacs/tree/develop/docs/bbrkc

Each link above provides access to more information regarding the project. As Gmacs is a live open-source project, many component parts and documents are incomplete, and are open to contributions from interested users and developers.

## Summary and Next Steps
The Gmacs modelling framework is now in full testing stage and is being scrutinised via the development of an example assessment model for Bristol Bay Red King Crab (BBRKC). The process of developing an example assessment model has been an excellent learning exercise and Gmacs can now satisfactorily reproduce the outputs of the existing ADFG-BBRKC assessment model. Gmacs already has more features than are required to reproduce the ADFG model for BBRKC, but may need further development before it can be used to develop assessment models for other stocks. The new and improved core modelling code is readily expandable, being structured and designed in a manner that should facilitate further development. The same development and review process that has been applied to the BBRKC model should thus be repeated for the Norton Sound Red King Crab (NSRKC) model, and then for other BSAI crab models. 

Tools and documentation in support of Gmacs have recently been extended and improved. Together with Gmacs itself, these extra tools support a much improved stock assessment process. Gmacs can be used to develop and run stock assessment models, and the supporting R package can be used to produce plots and diagnostics of Gmacs model outputs. These two tools can be used together with RStudio and RMarkdown to produce standardised and easily up-datable assessment reports. An example of this process has been developed and documented together with the example stock assessment for BBRKC.

The existing framework (Gmacs and its supporting software) have been carefully designed such that expansion and further development can be continued by others. There will be a new Research Associate beginning in 2015 to continue this work in collaboration with crab stock assessment authors. As the model develops further, it should assist the NPFMC and ADFG to greatly improve the overall management of BSAI Crab Fisheries.
