# Gmacs Progress Report 
## by Athol R. Whitten, September 2014

## Overview
Gmacs is a statistical catch-at-size population modeling framework. It is designed to be flexible, scalable, useful for both data-limited and data-rich situations, and initially, to improve and support management of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Island (BSAI) crab stocks of Alaska. The project is a collaborative effort between the University of Washington and NOAA Fisheries for the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council ([NPFMC](http://www.npfmc.org)). 

The Gmacs project is now hosted online at https://seacode.github.io, along with three other projects running in support of, or parallel to, Gmacs. Those projects are:

1. **`gmr`** an R package for plotting the results of Gmacs models; 
2. **`Cstar`** an ADMB library of common stock assessment routines which are used inside Gmacs; and
3. **`rstar`** an R package that facilitates plotting and understanding of Cstar functions.

A presentation outlining the motivation behind Gmacs, its capabilities, and its intended use as part of an improved stock assessment process, can be accessed at: https://seacode.github.io/reports/2014-09-slides.pdf

## Progress
Great progress has been made over the 2014 summer. The Gmacs source code has recently undergone a complete re-write, resulting in the addition of new and improved functionality and better-documented code. In additional, the Gmacs project now has:

1. An improved Github project page for collaborative model development: https://github.com/seacode/gmacs
2. Functioning core ADMB source code: https://github.com/seacode/gmacs/blob/develop/src/gmacs.tpl
3. A user- and developer-guide in wiki format: https://github.com/seacode/gmacs/wiki
4. A technical document in the form of a journal manuscript (currently a first-draft): https://github.com/seacode/gmacs/blob/develop/docs/manuscript/GLBAM.tex
5. A supporting R package for producing plots from Gmacs output files: https://github.com/seacode/gmr
6. A demonstration stock assessment model: https://github.com/seacode/gmacs/tree/develop/examples/demo
7. An associated report: https://github.com/seacode/gmacs/tree/develop/docs/bbrkc

Each link above provides access to more information regarding the project. As Gmacs is a live open-source project, many component parts and documents are incomplete, and are open to contributions from interested users and developers.

## Planning
The process of developing an example assessment model for Bristol Bay Red King Crab has been an excellent learning process. The same process should be repeated for the Norton Sound Red King Crab assessment, and then for other stocks. There will be a new Research Associate beginning in 2015 to continue this work in collaboration with crab stock assessment authors.

## Summary
The Gmacs modelling framework can now satisfactorily reproduce the results of the existing ADFG model for BBRKC. The new and improved core modelling code is readily expandable; model development should continue so that assessment models can be developed for other stocks. Gmacs has been designed to improve the overall stock assessment process, that is, the development of stock assessment models and their associated reports. The existing framework (Gmacs and its associated supporting software) have been carefully designed such that expansion and further development can continue. As the model develops further, it should assist the NPFMC to greatly improve the overall management of BSAI Crab Fisheries.
